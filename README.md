# Neuro-immune interactome

This repository accompanies the manuscript "Nociceptor neuroimmune interactomes
reveal common and injury-specific inflammatory pain pathways" and contains
code to generate the interactome.

The Python script to generate the interactome is at `interactome/core.py`.
Output files, including gene lists and generated CellPhoneDB input interaction tables
are in the `output` folder.
